Lightweight PSR-17 HTTP Factory mocking implementation tailored to simplify testing. This library mocks HTTP requests and is not intended for use in production.

This library inherits [psr-mock/http-message-implementation](https://github.com/psr-mock/http-message-implementation), thus also making it a provider of the same.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.0+

## Installation

```bash
composer require --dev psr-mock/http-factory-implementation
```

---

This library is not produced or endorsed by, or otherwise affiliated with, the PHP-FIG.
