Lightweight PSR-17 HTTP Factory mocking implementation tailored to simplify testing. This library mocks HTTP requests and is not intended for use in production.

This library inherits [psr-mock/http-message-implementation](https://github.com/psr-mock/http-message-implementation), therefore also making this a provider of PSR-7.
